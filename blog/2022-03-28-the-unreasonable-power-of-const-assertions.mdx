**We've all been there.** It is an unholy hour of the early morning. Your mind has deteriorated to little more than a sludge of grey matter. Your eyes are bloodshot from
your abiding caffiene dependency. Your hands have long since gnarled from the lashes of carpal tunnel and the endless droning your blue-switched mechanical keyboard.
The abandoned church from across the street tolls its cacophanous toll for what feels like the thousandth time tonight.
"Why?" you whimper to yourself.
"Why the heck won't my Typescript compile?".

<!--truncate-->

If you're anything like me, this is entirely not a joke. For some reason you can't explain, you end up programming into the early hours. It's at times like this that
the horror novel you've been reading begins to seep into your reality. You somehow come to know that you are the hapless acolyte chanting into the void with naught but a sage candle,
and the Typescript compiler is some mighty Elder God whose machniations are unknowable to mere mortals such as yourself.

Let's break down some compiler behaviour, take a deep dive into general (wide) type inference, how we can explicitly tell the compiler to instead infer narrow types, and how we can use this to our advantage.

Typescript is always going to try to infer a type from your variables. If you've done a good job keeping things typed so far, this will usually be really helpful in keeping track of the data you're operating on.
If there's some instance of an `any` variable in the data leading to the function you're working on now, then you might start to get a little burned by your own hubris. The worst case scenario is that everything is `any`, and you are just writing javascript with extra
steps for some unfathomable reason. 
But what about if i'm defining new variables from scracth that don't depend on any other data. Surely Typescript will always get it right and keep me covered, right?

...Right? 

Let's look at some examples. Starting with the humble `Array`. 

```
const arr = [];

arr.push(1);
arr.push("hello");
```

This is, annoyingly, valid Typescript. You can log this out and get `[ 1, 'hello' ]`. The reason this works is because at the point our `arr` variable is declared, Typescript does not know what our array _contains_. The type of `arr` is *inferred* as 
`any[]`. It is an array that can contain any data or object. Typescript is dropping type information for items inside. We can push anything we want. 

There are two remedies for this frighteningly dynamic behaviour: explicitly writing the type in the variable definition, or providing the array with some data at the point of declaration. 

If we now write our program as follows: 

```
const arr: string[] = [];

arr.push(1);
arr.push("hello");
```

We get the following error:

```
error TS2345: Argument of type 'number' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.

3 arr.push(1);
           ~
```

We cannot push a number to an array of strings. At the point of declaration, `arr` is of type `string[]`.

We can achieve the same effect by allowing typescript to infer this type from the initial declaration, like so:

```
const arr = [1];

arr.push(1);
arr.push("hello");
```

The compiler now fails for a similar reason:

```
error TS2345: Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.

4 arr.push("hello");
```

Our `arr` variable is declared with the type `number[]` based on the initial data we passed in.

Type inference is great if you're careful. Generally speaking though it is always a safer bet to explicitly type your data if there is any doubt about the integraity of the data going into the declaration. An inferred type cannot protect you against mistakes
because the compiler does not know your intention. Take the following example:

```
const a = 1;
const b = "2";
const c = 3;

const arrayOfNumbers = [a, b, c];
```

This code compiles just fine! And although you think your array can only contain numbers, a mistake has defined this type as `(string | number)[]`, meaning you are now able to unwittingly push strings to your array. This will absolutely cause you
unrecoverable heartache in the near future, as you weigh the heft of this silly mistake some point down the line.
If you had explicitly typed your array to begin with, then this issue is completely nullified for the rest of time:

```
const a = 1;
const b = "2";
const c = 3;

const arrayOfNumbers: number[] = [a, b, c];
```

```
error TS2322: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.

5 const arrayOfNumbers: number[] = [a, b, c];
                                       ~
```
You will never again be able to push strings to your array of numbers.



So now we know how type inference behaves. Let's look at a hidden pitfall. 

Take a look at this array declaration:

```
const arr = [1, 2];
```

What is the type of `arr`? Has typescript decided that this is an array of numbers, or a two-item array of numbers. There is a subtle difference between these two types of data. 

It turns out Typescript will infer the most general possible type for an inferred-type variable. `arr` above is an array of numbers: `number[]`. This means the compiler is expecting the data contained in `arr` to be a variable length array of numbers that 
we might push to, pop from, and slice up. Typescript is *not* expecting this variable, despite it's initial value, to remain as a fixed two-item tuple. 

This holds a few implications. Importantly, we cannot spread our `arr` variable to two specific values that can be used in a function. 

The following is not a valid program:

```
const arr = [1, 2];

const sum = (valueA: number, valueB: number) => {
  return valueA + valueB
}

console.log(sum(...arr))
```

Despite the fact that our `arr` variable is an array of two numbers, Typescript cannot guarantee this so it is rejected by the compiler:

```
error TS2556: A spread argument must either have a tuple type or be passed to a rest parameter.

7 console.log(sum(...arr))
                  ~~~~~~
```

This is invalid because, as discussed before, Typescript will always infer the most general type that is assignable to your data. `number[]` is more general than `[number, number]`, and so the former is used, even if the latter is technically correct. 

You can solve this one of two ways: you can either type the value of `arr` explicitly, or you can use a feature introduced in Typescript `3.4`: [const assertions](!https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-4.html#const-assertions).

**What the heck is a const assertion?**

Simply put - a const assertion tells the compiler that this data should be inferred to the narrowest possible type it is possible to give this data, and make it readonly for good measure. 

It looks like this:

```
const arr = [1, 2] as const;

const sum = (valueA: number, valueB: number) => {
  return valueA + valueB
}

console.log(sum(...arr))
```

This program is now valid. What is essentially happening is we have told Typescript to not bother with finding a general type for `arr`. We don't _want_ general. We want _exact_. We want a *narrow type*. It's essentially equivalent to writing:

```
const arr: readonly [number, number] = [1, 2];

const sum = (valueA: number, valueB: number) => {
  return valueA + valueB
}

console.log(sum(...arr))
```

Our program works because we have told the compiler that `arr` is always going to be a tuple of two numbers that is not going to change. It can happily spread these two numbers and use them safe in the knowledge that there are two of them, and our function
will be satisfied with all the arguments it needs to complete.


There is a cool use case for this in the wild: an alternative to `enum` where the keys of an `as const` array can be used in further type definitions. Considering that items in a readonly tuple can be indexed by number reliably, you can use `typeof arr[number]` to represent
the type for items contained in your `as const` array.

This can be extremely powerful when working with a utility such as *lodash* on a task such as stripping data from an object returned from an typed API call, where you know the kinds of keys on the returned object and you need to get the compiler to understand them too:

```
const { pick } = require("lodash");

const myObject = {
  a: 1,
  b: 2,
  c: 3,
  d: 4,
  e: 5
};

const keys = ["a", "b", "c"] as const;

const stripData = (object: Record<string, number>): Record<typeof keys[number], number> => {
  return pick(object, ...keys)
}

const stripped = stripData(myObject);
```

We can use an `as const` array to define our keys, and use these values to strip unecessary ones from our bloated object. And because we can use the idnexed value from our `as const` array as types as _well as_ values, we can define a strong return type
based on these values with a `Record`. Typescript now knows that `stripped` is an object of type `{a: number, b: number, c: number}`.

Good to know!

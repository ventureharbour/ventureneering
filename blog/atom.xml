        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hiring engineers is horribly difficult, you either have to make a call on someone with a tiny window of visibility or create a lengthy process that puts people off. In this article I show you how to hit that sweet spot of teasing out whether a candidate has the desired skills and behaviors, without spending weeks getting there.</p><p>We have a simple rule when it comes to hiring -<!-- -->_<!-- -->focus on trus_t. Developers come in so many different varieties and are typically rated based on their ability to code, or their understanding of the ‘process’ of development. Our aim in interviewing is to focus on how trustworthy the individual is: can we trust that they will work autonomously and take charge of their development? This can sound quite bizarre, and maybe a little scary at first, but in reality this just means that you want to hear more about the individual than you do their code. Our approach to this is an interview process that focuses on how their team works day-to-day, and benchmarking their technical expertise - which helps our understanding of the investment we would have to place in the candidate post hire.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="candidate-scoring">Candidate scoring<a class="hash-link" href="#candidate-scoring" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>As well as answering the fundamental question around trust, we also have to score the candidate against how we feel they will perform in the role - this is particularly vital in interviews for heavily contested roles (a really nice problem to have). We rate candidates across the same core areas that we expect them to perform in their role:</p><ol><li><strong>Results</strong> - the tangible business benefit of their effort. Will they deliver products, take ownership of their work, make positive decisions and create impact in their field?</li><li><strong>Direction</strong> - where the business is headed. Will they contribute to driving the business in the right direction, spot opportunities and pitfalls and help to steer the company?</li><li><strong>Talent</strong> - nurturing existing and contributing to find new hires. Will they push their own personal and professional development, help level up the team as a whole and contribute to hiring?</li><li><strong>Culture</strong> - maintaining our values and working environment. Will they collaborate with everyone fairly, communicate clearly and contribute to the heart of the company?</li><li><strong>Craft</strong> - technical ability. Do they have the skills currently (raw or experienced) that we are looking for?</li></ol><p>Our scoring is much like a golf scoring card, where we have a baseline for the role that is expected, we can then go two points above, or two points below that baseline. We expect that there could be some work required to get the individual to the required standard, but having this scoring allows us to compare candidates objectively.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="the-vh-engineer-interview">The VH Engineer Interview<a class="hash-link" href="#the-vh-engineer-interview" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="first-interview-technical-screening">First Interview: Technical Screening<a class="hash-link" href="#first-interview-technical-screening" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Prior to the interview we will ask the candidate to do one of two prepared technical tasks, tailored to be achievable in under 90 minutes. A large part of me loathes the use of technical tasks, but the alternative is to put the candidate on the spot during a meeting - but we’re not assessing how well a candidate can reason through nervousness, so an at-home test is a fairer approach . The end product of the technical task isn’t code - and we never ask directly for code to be provided. Instead we ask the candidate to present us through what they put together (we may request to look at the code in the session or ask them how they did certain things - but really the code always has to be theirs).</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/5rWjLZlllHZcau3a9fgMqbygHL309dO-a5wdHzQaiILv92-Lxp6EHpK55mSpyEVTgM41WsocWBuUIH8yWeXVvwubvaoJ2lArTj0ic_yOmkOc7rYR7tMz9Tx05nKf_afSzQ_LzLoL" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>This presentation is really important, and we instruct the candidate that we would like to see what choices they could’ve made as well as the choice they did make. As a fully remote team your ability to communicate effectively with peers on code, choices and architecture is actually more important than the code itself. Our aim is to find the candidates who can do this well, as we know they’re going to be much more effective when it comes to learning and developing.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="first-interview-they-interview-you">First Interview: They Interview You<a class="hash-link" href="#first-interview-they-interview-you" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>During the first interview it is also vital that you give the candidate the opportunity to interview the company. This is so often overlooked, or candidates are asked to just ‘email’ questions over because the interview is running late - this can’t be allowed to happen.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/gkuiVOUGkUS8MRfhGuysW5SsMOHZAeDtTDr0K6gq9oTELYKvJjQmx3OkVBaXxZFY3vlaeW-qVMIqJe63iwctnUqWmLhJKLFoHz3Rr-L0LXVl7BvV4yLNsCyICZ_HxwCHF8LvqG0x" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>We inform them prior to the meeting that they will have space in the interview to ask us questions, as it helps prompt them to prepare. So often the questions from candidates can almost be as useful as their answers to yours. Did they understand the role? Do they share the same values as the company? Do they understand all of the benefits - or sometimes lack of. Do they worry about the same sorts of issues as the rest of the team?</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="second-interview-collaboration--team-fit">Second Interview: Collaboration &amp; Team Fit<a class="hash-link" href="#second-interview-collaboration--team-fit" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>When progressing to a second interview we then take the development exercise one step further, inviting them to participate in a pair programming session with another of our developers - this requires no preparation prior to the session. Ideally this should be someone they have yet to meet - it’s important this person is seen less as an interviewer and more as a ‘future peer’. The paired task is always on the candidate's original submission project - again their code, their laptop, their session. The task is usually quite small and in code terms quite redundant, but represents a real day-to-day requirement of our team. They’ll be provided with a ticket and where possible will be left alone with the paired developer.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/AacP430pphG5NmuYHBNi2n3dq8MdHlc1FyAY2ZAe2ddPsxHmWLO5XM9YW4cCvGfQYBftTkZ_7YyuPdSgBl80fJNa1HaMagD-HUhOM86xAVOAKYWbGm44amZQ14MXJbUwTahrKN8z" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>Once complete we will ask the candidate and their pair to present back their solution to the ticket. The pairing developer knows to focus less on code and more on ‘what they would code’, so the task doesn’t have to end with delivery. Once complete - or at least solved logically - we invite the candidate and their pair to discuss with the interviewing party what they have done. We get their pair on the same side of the table to best replicate what day to day team work would be like, and how they handle that. Once the ‘development’ aspect is complete we move on to a more traditional Q&amp;A to try to score them on the other areas outside of day-to-day work.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="what-we-are-looking-for">What we are looking for<a class="hash-link" href="#what-we-are-looking-for" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>This process attempts to emulate our working day as closely as possible - pairing is a really effective exercise for all our team members and is vital to our day to day. What we ask our pairing developers to do is to note the sorts of things that came up during the conversations:</p><ul><li>Did they explain what exposure they have had to a particular technology?</li><li>Did they try to reason about the problem with a pseudo shorthand?</li><li>Did they ask questions about the ticket?</li><li>Did they look to break the ticket down into a number of different functions/classes etc?</li><li>Did they suggest looking up any documentation/other reference implementations (yes, I mean Stack Overflow)?</li></ul><p>It’s not to say that any of these is more important, or that there are any right answers, but the gist of what we want to see is they take the ticket seriously, focus on breaking down the issue, consider things before jumping in, and use the pair effectively.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="making-a-decision">Making a decision<a class="hash-link" href="#making-a-decision" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Our aim with all of the interviews is to get a number of score cards from the interviewers involved. Not all of them can be complete - as developers will focus on the craft aspect and maybe miss some parts of culture or talent and vice versa with the management Q&amp;A - but we end up with a complete picture. In most cases we can simply average the scores across scorecards, but where bigger disparities exist this will be the trigger for a conversation about that particular area - our aim here is always to have a singular rated scorecard.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/YIERRmv84X2Et0H94sA4S0BQDQqNCsAExMbWbrrVPuI9XSm6Wq_dsYRb5g3OTP7CSspRD6IJ29_y4SU_0w46ocyNI9IBkOmYWEEpv4Mm-RfXlC1m23T0vPkMQneRLEnXrI3n1G1n" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>With all the numbers in you may be able to see a clear objective winner, but sometimes a balancing act is required to judge whether having a higher ‘craft’ is more or less desirable compared to ‘Results’. Whatever happens, it’s important to trust your scoring - if you don’t then you need to rethink how you are scoring. Once a scored decision is made it’s important to review that against a more subjective decision, including asking interviewing members to make their choice is important too. We tend to only allow the objective score to lead our decision, but if the subjective ‘winner’ is different then it calls for a review.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="process-post-mortem">Process post mortem<a class="hash-link" href="#process-post-mortem" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Venture Harbour has a strong culture of retrospection, we are always looking at everything we do to see if it can be optimised or automated. From CEO through to coders, we empower people to put forward when something isn’t working for them, and work across the business to find solutions. Hiring is no exception, and when we get a new hire this represents a really good opportunity to question whether the process worked from their perspective. We find this to be a less useful exercise on day one, but after several months - even as part of a probation review - we ask questions about the process of how they came into the job. The questions aren’t rigid, but you want to pick at their experience of the process as an outsider.</p><ul><li>Did they find the pairing panic inducing?</li><li>Did our presentation of the role match the current reality?</li><li>Could we have done more to make them feel welcome?</li><li>Would they like to have seen more or less during the Q&amp;A?</li></ul><p>Regardless of how mature you believe your hiring process is, it is vital that you constantly evaluate it. The world changes, people evolve and different things become important to them - if you don’t recognise that you will fail. Get hiring right, and a lot of things click into place.</p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[as const assertions]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>We've all been there.</strong> The same problem for three days now. You've exhausted every developer in your team with your incessant quacking; there's no amount of rubber ducking that can help you. No matter who looks at it,
no matter their level of experience, no matter what phase-4 superpowers they might wield against the program, it does not make sense. You take a walk, eat some fruit, listen to that one banger that Iceland put out for the cancelled eurovision,
neck <em>another</em> coffee, and get back to frustrating your entire team with the endless clack-clack-clacking of your blue-switch keyboard.
You think you might have finally figured it out. Your eyes light up with relief measured in days. The build hasn't failed twenty seconds in this time. It's happening. It's really happening.</p><p>Nope. Just kidding.
Another type error.</p><p>If you've ever worked with Typescript, this is likely to have been your reality at some point or another. Especially if you have recently migrated from Typescript's more dynamic sibling: Javascript. For some reason you can't explain, you end up programming into the early hours. It's at times like this that
the horror novel you've been reading begins to seep into your reality. You somehow come to know that you are the hapless acolyte chanting into the void with naught but a sage candle,
and the Typescript compiler is some mighty Elder God whose machinations are unknowable to mere mortals such as yourself.</p><p>Let's break down some compiler behaviour, take a deep dive into general (wide) type inference, how we can explicitly tell the compiler to instead infer narrow types, and how we can use this to our advantage.</p><p>Typescript is always going to try to infer a type from your variables. If you've done a good job keeping things typed so far, this will usually be really helpful in keeping track of the data you're operating on.
If there's some instance of an <code>any</code> variable in the data leading to the function you're working on now, then you might start to get a little burned by your own hubris. The worst case scenario is that everything is <code>any</code>, and you are just writing javascript with extra
steps for some unfathomable reason.
But what about if i'm defining new variables from scracth that don't depend on any other data. Surely Typescript will always get it right and keep me covered, right?</p><p>...Right? </p><p>Let's look at some examples. Starting with the humble <code>Array</code>. </p><div class="codeBlockContainer_I0IT language-ts theme-code-block"><div class="codeBlockContent_wNvx" style="color:#F8F8F2;background-color:#282A36"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-ts codeBlock_jd64 thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_mRuA"><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token keyword" style="color:rgb(189, 147, 249);font-style:italic">const</span><span class="token plain"> arr </span><span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(248, 248, 242)">[</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(248, 248, 242)">]</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(248, 248, 242)">;</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">arr</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(248, 248, 242)">.</span><span class="token method function property-access" style="color:rgb(80, 250, 123)">push</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(248, 248, 242)">(</span><span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(248, 248, 242)">)</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(248, 248, 242)">;</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">arr</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(248, 248, 242)">.</span><span class="token method function property-access" style="color:rgb(80, 250, 123)">push</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(248, 248, 242)">(</span><span class="token string" style="color:rgb(255, 121, 198)">"hello"</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(248, 248, 242)">)</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(248, 248, 242)">;</span><br></span></code></pre><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="copyButton_eDfN clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_W9eQ" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_XEyF" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_i9w9" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div><p>This is, annoyingly, valid Typescript. You can log this out and get <code>[ 1, 'hello' ]</code>. The reason this works is because at the point our <code>arr</code> variable is declared, Typescript does not know what our array <em>contains</em>. The type of <code>arr</code> is <em>inferred</em> as
<code>any[]</code>. It is an array that can contain any data or object. Typescript is dropping type information for items inside. We can push anything we want. </p><p>There are two remedies for this frighteningly dynamic behaviour: explicitly writing the type in the variable definition, or providing the array with some data at the point of declaration. </p><p>If we now write our program as follows: </p><div class="codeBlockContainer_I0IT language-ts theme-code-block"><div class="codeBlockContent_wNvx"

Has typescript decided that this is an array of numbers, or a two-item array of numbers. There is a subtle difference between these two types of data. </p><p>It turns out Typescript will infer the most general possible type for an inferred-type variable. <code>arr</code> above is an array of numbers: <code>number[]</code>. This means the compiler is expecting the data contained in <code>arr</code> to be a variable length array of numbers that
we might push to, pop from, and slice up. Typescript is <em>not</em> expecting this variable, despite it's initial value, to remain as a fixed two-item tuple. </p><p>This holds a few implications. Importantly, we cannot spread our <code>arr</code> variable to two specific values that can be used in a function. </p><p>The following is not a valid program:</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_I0IT

always going to be a tuple of two numbers that is not going to change. It can happily spread these two numbers and use them safe in the knowledge that there are two of them, and our function
will be satisfied with all the arguments it needs to complete.</p><p>There is a cool use case for this in the wild: an alternative to <code>enum</code> where the keys of an <code>as const</code> array can be used in further type definitions. Considering that items in a readonly tuple can be indexed by number reliably, you can use <code>typeof arr[number]</code> to represent
the type for items contained in your <code>as const</code> array.</p><p>This can be extremely powerful when working with a utility such as <em>lodash</em> on a task such as stripping data from an object returned from an typed API call, where you know the kinds of keys on the returned object and you need to get the compiler to understand them too:</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_I0IT

"Regex... how how hard can it it be?" You ask yourself. Your fingers begin to bash upon your keyboard in the a-rhythmic way you've become accustomed to. You try to regain control of your thoughts from the dark cloud of self doubt, imposter syndrome and whether that last pastry was actually gluten free.
Languished you trawl the web in search of your liberator. "This is it..." you announce, "this is it...." as you click a link to an perlmonks.com forum post from 2004. Feverishly you scroll up and down the page copying and pasting into your IDE almost at random.
"DAMN IT!" you scream as your hammer the table with a clenched fist, sending the 3 day old tower of unwashed coffee cups crashing to the floor, another dead end.
"If only someone could write a blog post detailing and up-to-date way of obtaining user profiles from social media urls" you plead....

        <id>exhaustive-switch</id>
        <link href="https://ventureharbour.tech/blog/exhaustive-switch"/>
        <updated>2022-03-07T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Don't be afraid of the Typescript compiler - it only wants to be your friend.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>It's 2022, and we are in the golden age of web development</strong>. But for all the advancements that tools like Typescript have made in making our lives easier,
there are still things that it is missing that are staple features in other languages. Thankfully with a little work we are able to emulate some of these features
and make our lives easier, reduce the number of bugs we introduce, and make all our colleagues think we're awesome with our super esoteric programming skillz.</p><p>One of the features I miss dearly from languages like <em>Rust</em> and <em>ReScript</em> is <strong>pattern matching</strong>. And before anybody comes at me: <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pattern-matching" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">yes, there is a proposal for
pattern matching in Typescript</a>. And yes, this proposal should make us all very happy.</p><p>What <em>is</em> pattern matching? To quote the almighty <strong><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch06-02-match.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">book</a></strong>:</p><blockquote><p>Think of a match expression as being like a coin-sorting machine: coins slide down a track with variously sized holes along it, and each coin falls through the first hole it encounters that it fits into. In the same way, values go through each pattern in a match, and at the first pattern the value “fits,” the value falls into the associated code block to be used during execution.</p></blockquote><p>Now this sounds a lot like something that already exists in both Typescript and javascript: the <code>switch</code> statement. And for the most part, a <code>switch</code> does act in much the same
way as a fully-featured <code>match</code>, though with some drawbacks. The main one we're going to focus on here is that <code>switch</code> cases in Typescript
are <strong>not exhaustive</strong>. This means there is no guarantee that your <code>switch</code> is going to handle all possible values of your <code>switch</code> case.
Incidentally, in a <code>match</code> in a strongly typed language like <em>Rust</em>, this exhaustiveness is <strong>guaranteed</strong> statically by the compiler. You must handle <strong>all possible</strong> cases
before your code will even run.</p><p>This has some advantages. Primarily this aids development in larger teams where multiple engineers are working broadly in the same area.
I could create a <code>match</code> that handles some variant of a union type or enum, and we would never have to worry about a co-worker
adding a new value to the case and forgetting to handle it. Compiler says no. Your co-worker is forced to add the logic they missed. Bugs are avoided. Everyone is happy.</p><p>You don't get this advantage with a <code>switch</code>.</p><p>"But James, you stupid human", you say. "You realise you can use 'default' in a switch, right?".</p><p>Absolutely there is an option to use default, but also if you use it as a catch-all for things that you're willing to forget, then
you probably deserve the bugs that are about to come swarming your way.
The issue is that <code>default</code> really does just mean <em>default behaviour</em> that is non-specific to the value being passed to your switch. You
should probably not rely on it to handle missing cases in types that have distinctly known possible values at the point of compilation.</p><blockquote><p>NOTE: This does not apply to things like <code>string</code> and <code>number</code> where you really can have a functionally infinite set of values. Cases like this
you should use <code>default</code> in a switch because you literally don't have any other choice. Though this is a problem that favours eliminating <a href="https://refactoring.guru/smells/primitive-obsession" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">primitive obsession</a>
in favour of using stronger types for your data (such as <code>enum</code> and <code>union</code>), we'll discuss that another time.</p></blockquote><p>So what can we do about this? How can we ask the Typescript compiler to check this for us at compile-time?</p><p>Enter <strong>NEVER</strong>!</p><p>If you haven't come across if before, <code>never</code> is a powerful Typescript type that tells the compiler that the value in question can never occur.
Everything is assignable to <code>never</code>, but <code>never</code> is not assignable to anything. <code>any</code> isn't even assignable to <code>never</code>. It is the ultimate
last word in telling the compiler that this value must never occur.</p><p>Things like functions that solely throw errors are inferred to return <code>never</code>, and that's how functions that throw can influence
the control flow of a function.</p><p>We can also use <code>never</code> to force a <code>switch</code> case to be exhaustive, by telling it that the <code>default</code> case is <code>never</code>.</p><p>Let's produce an example in literally the only context that has any meaning to me anymore: currency from A Song of Ice and Fire:</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_I0IT

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>This week we have been working with remote APIs, Webhooks and OAuth</strong>. Those alone will be blogged about plenty in the future, but in doing this task we have bourne another mini project that we have found really useful. Typically, when doing this sort of work, I've always had this habit of running a dummy server that logs out requests and blindly responds to them. This helps me see what is going on, and what external things are either redirecting or posting directly to our APIs. Up to now I have never really done much more than run a server where all requests are <code>console.log</code>'ed and <code>res.send('ok')</code>'ed, but this time around added an SQLite backed so I could see request history, and a nice front end so the payloads were readable. <a href="https://npmjs.com/wrestly" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">So here is <em>wrestly</em></a></p><div style="text-align:center"><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Our Glorious Mascot" src="/assets/images/logo-6eab9b24879d187ebbedae9eb001c4f4.svg" width="87" height="80" class="img_E7b_"></p></div><p><strong>Wrestly</strong> is a simple http server that will accept any requests and store their <code>body</code>, <code>headers</code> and <code>cookies</code> as well as any <code>query</code> params into a SQLite DB. It allows you to list the requests already made, and look at each one in detail. We don't really focus on the response, it just gives you a nice <code>200</code> and whatever the contents of the original request was. Routes that go via <code>/api/**/*</code> paths will always respond with JSON - which was useful for us - otherwise it just shows Wrestly's own webpage with the contents of the original request. It'll parse any <code>JSON</code> or <code>x-www-form-urlencoded</code> bodies included with requests, and it'll also record the <code>method</code> and <code>url</code>.</p><figcaption align="center">Lists of requests that have come in</figcaption><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Listing" src="/assets/images/listing-98803e57fbd618c29d91830faa8732d1.png" width="2526" height="2004" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>You can access the list view at <code>http://localhost:6789/_x</code> and it should show all recorded requests to date. <em>Note</em> that by default requests are stored in memory, so if you quit <code>wrestly</code> and start again it'll clear saved requests.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>It seems to be a tradition</strong> that every blog I start I start with a well wishing <em>hello world</em> post. So here I am, saying it again, <em>hello world</em>. This time I have the might of the entire Ventureneering team behind me and we have a lot to share, both to one another and the rest of the wider community. So welcome, I'm really glad you came along ❤️.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="questions">Questions?<a class="hash-link" href="#questions" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="how-will-this-be-different-to-ventureharbourcom">How will this be different to ventureharbour.com?<a class="hash-link" href="#how-will-this-be-different-to-ventureharbourcom" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h5><p>So we are eager to get more mass appeal content from the engineers on the main site, and really this can act as the catalyst and breeding ground for that content. Not that content has to be editorially more or less significant. It's just tonally and demographically the main blog is very different, so this is a place without borders - albeit I hope we would all embody the Venture Harbour spirit! We can also experiment with interactive content a lot easier on this site, with <a href="https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/react" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docusaurus allowing MDX content</a> you can embed experiments directly into the page!</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="how-do-i-get-stuff-on-here">How do I get stuff on here?<a class="hash-link" href="#how-do-i-get-stuff-on-here" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h5><p>The <a href="https://github.com/ventureharbour/ventureneering" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">repository exists publicly</a> so internal or external collaborators can submit PRs and we would be delighted to review them. <a href="https://docusaurus.io/docs/blog#adding-posts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check out the Docusaurus docs</a> if you are having issues, we can always help get things looking just right if you struggle, so just open issues on our repo if you can't get something working.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="what-can-i-write-about">What can I write about?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-can-i-write-about" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h5><p>Anything you think is interesting. It's a great place to share <em>links</em> to interesting articles, <em>libraries</em> or <em>tech</em> that you find whilst journeying through your life as a developer. You can also <em>teach</em> us something, or give us a <em>TIL</em> (today I learned) - short posts are totally totally fine, it doesn't need to be epic, but it can also be epic!!</p>]]></content>

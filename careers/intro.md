# VentureHarbour Engineering Career Framework

> **Disclaimer**
> 
> This work is heavily inspired by the Dropbox Engineering Careers Framework, but is heavily modified to suit a 'venture focussed' engineering teams requirements.

## What's a Career Framework?

The Engineering Career Framework is your source for how to achieve impact for your role and team and how to grow in your engineering career.

## What the Career Framework is not

This framework is not a promotion checklist for your role; rather, it’s designed to help you figure out what your impact could look like at the next level.

This framework is not an exhaustive list of examples and behaviors; each responsibility includes three to four key behaviors that serve as guide for how to think about your work. Consequently, you’ll need to meet with your manager to define your impact goals and align on the expectations for your role. 

## What’s in a Career Framework?

This framework is broken down into two components:
* Level Expectations define the scope, collaborative reach, and levers for impact at every level; these expectations are the what that determines the difference between an ENG2 and ENG3, for example
* Core and Craft Responsibilities define the key behaviors specific to your role and team; these behaviors help you identify how you work to deliver impact based on your level expectations 

## How to navigate this framework

Success in any role at Venture Harbour is determined largely on impact. Your key aim as an engineer should be on delivering as much impact as possible in your daily work. Since impact can be a bit vague, read What is Impact?

Next, ground yourself in the expectations of your role. For each role, you'll find a one line summary as well as the role's scope, reach and levers for impact. This will give you a solid understanding of your remit, the companies expectations and what is in your control to push you forward.

Review the expected behaviours for that role, behaviours are related to responsibilites, and responsibilities are under a specific facet of all roles.

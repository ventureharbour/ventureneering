## :moon: Anti-Patterns

Zero ownership of problems and solutions, offloads 'blame'/'criticism' to team members. Does not foster healthy team dynamic, ensure personal success over team improvement. Does not embody the Venture Harbour culture and values, and/or loses team members due to inequality with other teams.

## :owl: Craft

Like Staff Engineers, I have a well-rounded set of technical skills and development methodologies, and apply them with a sophisticated approach that is best suited for each project. I design systems that are far from my previous experience, anticipating scale and scope beyond the current requirements at Venture Harbour or in areas otherwise unexplored. I make or participate in discussions around making sweeping technical choices that lack clearly correct answers, but am able to articulate the rationale and technical vision behind those choices. I partner with cross-functional stakeholders to identify major new business opportunities unlocked by technical capabilities.

<Responsibilities content={{
  'Code fluency': [
    `I write code that captures the essential nature of the solution and is appropriately flexible, reusable, efficient, and adaptable to changing requirements.`,
    `I ensure high code quality in code reviews.`,
    `I have a strong awareness of the ecosystem of tools and libraries supporting my primary programming language and development environment and a strong grasp of the idioms and patterns of my language. I may be intimately familiar with the open source community surrounding it.`
  ],
  'Software design': [
    `I am able to independently design software components in well scoped scenarios, with simplicity and maintenance as key considerations. My components are testable, debuggable and have logical APIs, with documentation, that are not easily misused.`,
    `I know when to make significant refactors and when it’s better to leave things as-is.`,
    `I have a strong grasp of the libraries, platforms, and systems that I rely on, allowing me to apply them expertly`
  ],
  'Architecture Design': [
    `I’m able to decompose problems or business scenarios into solutions composed of multiple software components interacting with each other`,
    `I proactively identify issues with technical dependencies of my project that are owned by other teams and surface them`

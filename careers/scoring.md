# Scoring

At regular intervals all members of the engineering team will undergo a review of their current key behaviours to identify progress and effectiveness on their role. This will also act as a good opportunity to move people onto a more suitable role, or to monitor any areas of required improvement.

# Areas of Concern

All roles focus their spec on five areas of concern that all engineers will be reviewed on.

## :trophy: Results

This often means some tangible business benefit of your efforts, whether that be resolving bug tickets, shipping new features or making the right decisions for a project. This area rewards product, pragmatism and delivery for our end customers - with increasing scope of responsibility in the higher levels. _The key responsibilities in this area_ are **Impact**, **Ownership**, **Decision Making** and **Operational Excellence**.

## :star: Direction

Everyone in the team is expected to pull the business in the right direction. This area is how active you are at taking on, or introducing, new or changes to existing process. Where **Results** is about the now **Direction** is about the future. _The key responsibilities in this area_ are **Agility**, **Innovation**, and **Strategy**.

## :evergreen_tree: Talent

With a growing and evolving team, there is a requirement to always nurture and seek out talent. Whether this is directly being invovled in hiring, or being responsible for the development of existing team members. It's also important that your own growth is proactively managed, with regular feedback and reflection. _The key responsibilities in this area_ are **Personal Growth**, **Hiring**, **Talent Development** and **Organizational Planning**.

## :rainbow: Culture

As the team grows, and other members join it's important that values and working environment are maintained to the required standard. Our ability to recognise, manage and ultimately benefit from a diverse culture of employees is something that everyone needs to take on, at all levels. This can be as small as regularly reaching out to pair with colleagues to resolving conflict and communicating clearly. _The key responsibilities in this area_ are **Collaboration**, **Organizational Health** and **Communication**.

## :owl: Craft

As engineers your most important quality is your craft, this is your technical ability. Each role, apart from management roles, will contain a description that relates to the specific area of excellence that is expected in terms of engineering craft. _The key responsibilties in this area are changeable between different disciplines but typically_ are **Code fluency**, **Software Design** and **Architectural Design**.

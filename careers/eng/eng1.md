> I deliver lots of high quality production-ready code with direction from the team.

| **Scope** <br /> *Area of ownership and level of autonomy / ambiguity* | **Collaborative Reach** <br /> *Organizational reach and extent of influence* | **Impact Levers** <br /> *Technical levers typically exercised to achieve business impact* |

## :moon:  Anti-Patterns

Poor code quality. No clear improvement in craft/ability. Not self-motivated; needs someone to constantly prod, won't active seek work. Constantly veers into the weeds. More inclined to blame-complain than roll up sleeves. General helplessness. Disregards team process.

#### Good Examples

* *A ticket to implement a key feature was delivered on time and spec by the employee*. **Areas: Results**
* *Employee managed to find a really tricky bug case in a pull request review*, this was brought up to the author and resolved before hitting staging/production. **Areas: Results & Craft**
*

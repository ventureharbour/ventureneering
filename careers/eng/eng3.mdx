## :moon: Anti-Patterns

Not the oracle of all things _insert your domain here_. Insular, does not look to level up the entire organisation by presenting, sharing or implementing process. Does not seek opportunites to mentor individuals who show lack of ability, or confidence in the specific domain.

## :owl: Craft

I have a well-rounded set of technical skills in my specialist area and apply them with a sophisticated approach that is best suited for each project. I am a master of designing simple, flexible software components, enforce the quality of my team’s designs and provide quality feedback on designs of related areas. I ensure my team’s work fits with the broader technical strategy of the organization. I am called to design software or systems in the face of significant ambiguity or a large number of dependencies, and my designs do not anticipate the maintainers to have my expertise. I work with cross-functional partners to discover novel technical solutions to business problems.

<Responsibilities
  content={{
    "Code fluency": [
      `I write code that captures the essential nature of the solution and is appropriately flexible, reusable, efficient, and adaptable to changing requirements.`,
      `I ensure high code quality in code reviews.`,
      `I have a strong awareness of the ecosystem of tools and libraries supporting my primary programming language and development environment and a strong grasp of the idioms and patterns of my language. I may be intimately familiar with the open source community surrounding it.`,
    ],
    "Software design": [
      `I design software components that are difficult to misuse and flexible in the face of an increase in the number of adjacent use cases as appropriate to the direction of the business (neither under nor over-designed)`,
      `I reduce complex designs and concepts to simple foundational components through correct choices of data structures, applications of algorithms, or other deep insight into the problem space and create simple interfaces to complex underlying systems.`,
      `I’m able to review designs in related areas with high quality and ensure quality for cross-team cross-module design/API issues`,
      `I may have deep expertise in implementation or principles behind some of the libraries, platforms and systems relevant to my team's work and my personal area of expertise`,
    ],
    "Architecture Design": [
      `I make correct technology choices for components needed as part of a larger architecture, including making build vs buy choices for specific components, and choosing frameworks`,
      `I’m capable of owning the overall health and engineering quality of a system or collection of features - e.g. driving regular health reviews, curating test strategy, etc - and ensuring that the health and maintenance of my systems do not depend on the maintainers having my expertise`,
      `I’m capable of driving overall testing strategy of a significant system with high reliability or quality requirements (e.g. building validation systems or new test frameworks to do so)`,
      `I’m capable of designing systems with significant ambiguity and/or lots of systems that depend on it`,
    ],
    "Technical Strategy": [
      `I’m accountable for alignment of the software and systems in my area to overall technical strategy, making tradeoffs where appropriate in consultation with the wider engineering group`,
